# NFT E-Ticketing :ticket:

Project developed within the scope of the LDS curricular unit.

### About the project :wave:
This project is an implementation of an NFT e-ticketing system using React JS, ASP.NET, and Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The goal of this project is to create a secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof ticketing system using non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

### Basic Overview :eyes:
- Create an event on the system's organizer panel
- Users can purchase tickets for the event using Binance Coin (BNB)
- The system will mint a unique NFT for each ticket purchased
- Users can view and manage their ticket NFTs in their wallet
- At the event, the system will verify the authenticity of the NFTs for entry

### Smart Contracts :bookmark_tabs:
